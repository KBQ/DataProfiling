# Schema-level – According to schema, we can
# compute statistical features such as class / properties
# usage count, class / properties usage per
# subject and per object or class / properties hierarchy
# depth.


# 2. Instance-level – Features on this level are computed
# according to the data only, i.e.,URI usage
# per subject (/object), triples having a resource
# (/blanks) as subject (/object), triples with literals,
# min(/max/avg.) per data type (integer / float /
#                                 time, etc.), number of internal and external links,
# number of ingoing (/outgoing) links per instance,
# number of used languages per literal, classes distribution
# as subject (/object) per property, property
# co-occurrence
